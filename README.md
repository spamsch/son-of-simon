## What is this?

Son of Simon is a personal assistant for macOS. It helps you with everyday tasks using the apps you already have - Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, and Safari. It can also handle websites when needed.

You do not need to code. Most people just download the app, sign in, and start asking.

## What it can do

- Summarize your inbox and find important emails
- Create calendar events and reminders
- Search your notes
- Open and control Safari tabs
- Fill out simple web forms (bookings, purchases, etc.)
- Send and receive messages over Telegram (text or voice)
- Run daily or weekly routines (optional)

## How it works (simple version)

- It uses your built-in Apple apps instead of screen scraping
- It uses the browser only when it has to
- It can listen to your Telegram voice messages if you want remote control

## Get started (most people)

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from Releases
2. Drag Son of Simon to your Applications folder
3. Open it and follow the setup steps

The setup wizard will guide you through:
- Connecting your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider)
- Granting macOS permissions
- Optional Telegram setup

- If you enable Telegram, messages go through Telegram
- Local data is stored in `~/.macbot` (settings, logs, and memory)
