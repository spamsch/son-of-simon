## What is this?

Son of Simon is an AI assistant for macOS that works directly with your built-in Apple apps — Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, and Safari. Think of it as the macOS automation layer that OpenClaw is missing.

Where tools like OpenClaw need browser scraping or OAuth flows to access Gmail or Office 365, Son of Simon uses Apple's native app integration. Just add your account in Apple Mail or Calendar and the agent can use it. No tokens, no OAuth, no browser automation needed.

Skills are compatible with the [AgentSkills standard](https://agentskills.io) used by OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Cursor — so community skills work across tools.

You do not need to code. Download the app, sign in, and start asking.

## What it can do

- Summarize your inbox and find important emails
- Create calendar events and reminders
- Search your notes
- Open and control Safari tabs
- Fill out simple web forms (bookings, purchases, etc.)
- Send and receive messages over Telegram (text or voice)
- Run daily or weekly routines (optional)

## How it works (simple version)

- It uses your built-in Apple apps instead of screen scraping
- It uses the browser only when it has to
- It can listen to your Telegram voice messages if you want remote control

## Get started (most people)

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from Releases
2. Drag Son of Simon to your Applications folder
3. Open it and follow the setup steps

The setup wizard will guide you through:
- Connecting your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider)
- Granting macOS permissions
- Optional Telegram setup

## Skills (AgentSkills compatible)

Skills provide guidance for handling specific types of requests. Son of Simon comes with built-in skills for Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Safari, and Browser Automation. You can enable or disable skills, customize built-in ones, or create your own.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/skills-list.png" alt="Skills List" width="500">
</p>

Each skill defines:
- Which apps and tasks it uses
- Example prompts that trigger it
- Safe defaults to prevent mistakes
- Actions that require your confirmation

</p>

Custom skills are saved to `~/.macbot/skills/`. Skills use the **AgentSkills standard** (the same SKILL.md format used by OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Cursor) so you can drop in skills from any compatible tool and they just work.

## Requirements

- macOS
- Apple apps configured (Mail, Calendar, Reminders)
- Internet access for your AI provider
- Optional: Telegram bot for remote access

## Privacy and safety

- Your email, calendar, and reminders stay in Apple apps
- The assistant sends prompts to your AI provider to understand your request
- If you enable Telegram, messages go through Telegram
- Local data is stored in `~/.macbot` (settings, logs, and memory)
